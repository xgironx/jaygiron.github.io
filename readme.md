# Wendy Bite

Your client, Wendy, has created "pixel-perfect" images representing how she wants her website to look, and provided the text. Make her site!

Create a file called `style.css` in the root directory.

She knows a thing or two about web design, so be sure your HTML and CSS validate.

To check whether your CSS validates, the instructors will be using this site:

https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

You will notice that certain characters do not render properly. For example, this appears in the header: `RÃ©sumÃ©`. You need to fix this. Start by Googling "strange HTML characters".
